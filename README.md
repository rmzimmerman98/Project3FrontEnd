# Project 3 Frontend

## Technology Used

MERN Stack with CSS for styling

## Issues

in the frotend part the issues we faced were the strech goals we wanted to achieve:

## Using Mapbox:

the markers that are being fetched fron the API will only show up in the right place when we zoom in all the way to level 20.
Otherwise the markers float around the map randomly 

## Using Filtering:

we had a lot of issues trying to figure out filtering functionality. now that we got it to work we can only show one piece of information and we're not able to style it yet. 

## Pagination:
Pagination was not working in the beginning but we got it to work eventually.

## Heroku
Heroku gave us a lot of headache until Randall figure it out
